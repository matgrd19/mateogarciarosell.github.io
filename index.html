    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I have an engineering background and a curiosity for systems that solve real problems. I’m fascinated by how data, networks, and human behavior develop and integrate over time, whether in financial technologies, educational tools, or social computing platforms. This perspective allows me to identify patterns, anticipate system-level effects, and design solutions that deliver tangible impact. Language learning has been a personal and intellectual pursuit for years, giving me insight into how knowledge is acquired, conveyed, and spread, and how new educational tools can support varied learning styles.</p><p>I also enjoy hands-on work with electronics and mechatronics, combining technical skill with creative problem-solving. Outside of work, I enjoy hiking, reading, and exploring different kinds of music, which keep me curious and energized. Together, these experiences shape how I approach learning, problem-solving, and building tools, skills I bring to every project I take on, especially those aimed at creating meaningful impact through technology.</p>
